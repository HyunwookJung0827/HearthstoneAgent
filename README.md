Succeeded in fixing Yolov5 prototype. It was all about Linux, so I built a new virtual environment in my anaconda.
Will report again if I succeed in implementing it in my main code.

Succeeded with Video screening with OBS.
I want a card number recognizer. It sounds hard. I'm thinking about recognizing some blue colors of each card (mana cost is blue) in specific (x, y) position. And having some templates for each number of cards 0 - 10.
Any card content would be considered after I am done with the card number recognizer. Next is Field unit number recognizer I assume.
